# etch-a-sketch
This project is a digital version of the classic Etch A Sketch toy.

### Reflection
This project was certainly fun and challenging at the same time. For starters, making the initial grid was no problem for me. The tricky part was adjusting the size of the pixels for the grid while keeping the grid in place. But after reviewing the material and debugging the issues at hand, I managed to get it to work. From there, I was able to add a random color utility and a clear button for the user to erase the grid. Fixing bugs has taught me not only how to solve problems effectively, but also how to appreciate the end result even more.
